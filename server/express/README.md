# NodeJs based express server

This will eventually replace Java/Jetty server. Since both client and server will be written with same language this will allow sharing of types and code between the two. Also reduce learning overhead and maintenance costs of multiple technologies.

## Run

```
npm run start
```

Open http://localhost:8000

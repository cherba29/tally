# GraphQL Tally server.

To run

Assuming in project directory `tally`, the server can be started as

```
cd server/apollo
node dist/server
```

It serves files from the client registering them under `/app` path.
So to load it open http://localhost:4000/app/js_summary.html

This version of the server is [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com) based.

In a terminal run

```
npm run build
```

wou will get

```
webpack is watching the filesâ€¦
```

Than in another terminal, start the server:

```
npm run start
```

By default, it will start server at http://localhost:4000/.

In the query/mutation window (left pannel), enter a query like

```
{
  accounts {
    name
  }
}
```
